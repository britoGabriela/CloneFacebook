# Clone of Facebook app home screens

Project developed with the intention of cloning Facebook app home screens in Flutter for personal study of the Dart programming language.

This is what I've done so far, but it's still in development.

For now, you can check the app's localization & internationalization by changing the system language on your Android phone (available in Portuguese, English and Spanish).
